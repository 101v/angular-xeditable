h1 Overview
:markdown
  **Angular-xeditable** is javascript library that allows you to create edit-in-place elements
  in [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) projects.  
  It is based on ideas of [x-editable](http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable) but was written from scratch
  to use power of angular and support complex forms / editable grids.

h4 Dependencies

  Basically it does not depend on any libraries except [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) itself.    
  For themes you may need to include [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) CSS.  
  For some extra controls (e.g. datepicker) you may need to include [angular-ui bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/).
